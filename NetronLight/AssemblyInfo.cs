/// A 'light' version of the Netron graph control
/// without all the advanced diagramming stuff
/// see however http://netron.sf.net for more info.
/// This control shows the simplicity with which you can still achieve good results,
/// it's a toy-model to explore and can eventually help you if you want to go for a 
/// bigger adventure in the full Netron control.
/// Question and comments are welcome via the forum of The Netron Project or mail me
/// [Illumineo@users.sourceforge.net]

/// Thank you for downloading the code and your feedback!
